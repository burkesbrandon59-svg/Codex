The Manuscript is the Doctrine.
The Backend is the Spine.
The Frontend is the Face.
The Dashboards are the Eyes.
The Vortex is the Breath.
The Mirror is the Pulse.
The Heatmap is the Temperature.
The Entity Breakdown is the Skeleton.
The Cycle Chart is the Heartbeat.
The Infrastructure is the Bones beneath the Bones.

121.5 is the inner tone (1+2+1+5 = 9).
432 is the outer tone (4+3+2 = 9).
Their ratio is the corridor (3.555... → 9).
